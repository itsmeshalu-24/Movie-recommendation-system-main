# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Capstone Project** completed as part of the **Edureka Data Science with SQL** course.  
It showcases a complete movie recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset**.

---

## 📚 About the Project

The project implements three types of recommendation systems:

1️⃣ **Popularity-Based Recommender**:  
Recommends top-rated movies in a selected genre with a minimum review threshold.

2️⃣ **Content-Based Recommender**:  
Suggests movies similar to a selected one based on genre similarity using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.

3️⃣ **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**:  
Provides personalized movie recommendations based on ratings from similar users.

Interactive inputs and colorful visualizations make it easy to experiment with different genres, movies, and user IDs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to create personalized content discovery systems, similar to platforms like Netflix or Prime Video.

---
## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and similarity computations
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualizations
- **MovieLens Dataset**: Real-world dataset for movies and ratings
- **SQL** (Course Context): While this project uses CSVs, concepts from **SQL querying and data extraction** are applied as part of the Edureka Data Science with SQL course

## 🎯 Recommender Systems Implemented

### 1️⃣ Popularity-Based Recommender
- Input: Genre, Minimum number of reviews, Number of recommendations
- Output: Top-rated movies in the selected genre

### 2️⃣ Content-Based Recommender
- Input: Movie title, Number of similar movies to recommend
- Output: Similar movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

### 3️⃣ Collaborative Filtering Recommender
- Input: User ID, Number of similar users (K), Number of recommendations
- Output: Personalized movie recommendations based on user similarity

## 📚 Dataset Description

The data used in this project comes from the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), a widely used dataset in recommender systems research.

- **movies.csv**: Contains `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.  
- **ratings.csv**: Contains `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.

- Key Highlights
  
1. Interactive user inputs for all three recommdation models

2. Clear and colorful data visualizations using Plotly

3. Clean and well-commented code with explanations

4.Real-world application of data science concepts from the **Edureka Data Science with SQL** course

---
- Future Enhancements

Add advanced collaborative filtering (SVD, matrix factorization)

Build a web-based interface using Streamlit or Flask

Incorporate user feedback for dynamic recommendations
